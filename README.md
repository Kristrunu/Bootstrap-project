BOOTSTRAP PROJECT - FLÓRA

I made a Bootstrap page that sells plants online called FLÓRA. I made two layouts - index and "about us" section. See by clicking the About Us link in the nav bar on the site.
I used a nav bar, hero section, containers, cards, icons and forms from Bootstrap and the website is fully responsive.
The only thing I did not use from Bootstrap where the background colors. I used css to add the colors I wanted.
